# Smart Sass Importer is deprecated. There is now an [official plugin](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/master/import-once/README.md) and you should use it 

Sass compiler with a twist. The twist is a importer which will only import a file ONCE!

How To
-----------

1. Clone it to your machine

        git clone https://github.com/theblacksmith/smartsass.git
        
2. Link

        sudo ln -s /path/to/smartsass/ssass /usr/local/bin/ssass
        
3. Go!

    `ssass` (note the extra **s** before sass) accept all the options `sass` does. In fact, you'll be using the sass command line tool! All ssass does is step in before the action begins and setup a special filesystem importer.
